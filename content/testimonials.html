                <div class="well"><strong>Jemma Pink: Director of Corporate Systems, Six Degrees Technology Group
                    Ltd</strong>
                    <p>
                        I directly managed Alan for two years as my Head of Development at Six Degrees Group. We worked
                        closely together on business critical transformation projects where Alan always delivered. Rated
                        by his team as an exceptional manager, he was able to consistently inspire and lead them to
                        deliver technical solutions to specification, within time and to budget constraints necessary.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is a focused and driven individual with a genuine passion for his craft. Responsible for all
                        aspects of the development lifecycle including solution & technical architecture, design, build,
                        test & deployment. Alan is an extremely safe pair of hands with an ability to operate
                        effectively at both a strategic level and immersed in the finest of detail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alan is an asset to any organisation and I recommend him unreservedly.
                    </p>

                <div class="well"><strong>Rob Peddle, Director, The High Performance Organisation Group Ltd.</strong>
                    <p>
                        Alan was asked to create an online reporting tool to integrate our unique and completely
                        redesigned online assessment tool, with the aim of significantly enhancing the way we reported
                        from it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key requirements were high levels of flexibility, speed, security and availability.
                        Based on outline report template specifications, Alan was instrumental in helping to develop
                        these specifications designing, building and architecting a much faster more flexible reporting
                        tool, with excellent knowledge of the whole hardware stack. </p>
                    <p>
                        Alan responded rapidly to changes
                        and further ideas throughout the process and was very efficient in the way he worked during the
                        project. I would thoroughly recommend Alan for this type of work.

                        If you need somebody to get the best from the people or to find out quickly how to solve a
                        problem using a computer he’s your man. Grows and gives room to grow. Able to switch his focus
                        between the forest and the bushes as needed. Always humble, always learning, always
                        experimenting.

                        Alan has been a pleasure to work. From the beginning he fully understood the project
                        requirements and made many helpful suggestions as to how we could improve the system.The project
                        was finished well ahead of schedule and under budget. On more than one occasion Alan worked late
                        into the night – a clear indicator that he loves his work!
                    </p>

                        I look forward to working with Alan in the future and would have no hesitation in recommending
                        him to anyone.

                        Alan Hollis joined the Symble development team in June 2012 to help plan the architecture of our
                        next-generation platform. From the initial meeting, he showed great enthusiasm toward the
                        project and has always the best interest of the product in mind.Alan is a highly experienced and
                        talented developer with excellent communication skills and a highly professional approach to

                        He goes on to make extra suggestions to improve projects, performing code reviews and always
                        helps other team members. He also pays very close attention to all the details and delivers
                        stable code and scalable solutions.

                    <p>When I look for a developer, I'm looking for someone who's highly intelligent, able
                        to turn a hand to anything, and is not afraid to point out flaws or try to improve something. If
                        you're looking for a robot, Alan is not your man. Alan is brilliant at spotting problems before
                        they
                        exist and pulling in his experience and putting it to work on your project. His work ethic and
                        dedication is second to none. I'd recommend Alan to anyone.

                    <p>Alan is an excellent programmer. He proved to quickly understand the business
                        drivers and developed applications to meet our needs with little of the usual specification
                        detail
                        required by most developers. He's independent and takes a great deal of pride in his work as was
                        evident by his continued strive to improve system performance. It was a pleasure to work with
                        him.

                    <p>Firstly I would like to say it has been a great pleasure working with Alan on a
                        number of web based projects, I am delighted he called asking for this reference.

                        I first met Alan whilst studying at the University of Portsmouth, he has always been very
                        entrepreneurial and hardworking, looking to create his own unique brands and products. Like most
                        students, after graduating (2005) we went our separate ways in life / business however we
                        regularly
                        kept in-touch, often chatting on MSN about all things web related. Alan first helped Tidy Design
                        back in January 2009, when I sold our first hotel website / booking engine. Alan is the coder
                        genius
                        behind this bespoke system / database that has subsequently gathered interest from a global
                        audience.

                        http://hotelbookingreservationsystem.com/about-us.html

                        I would recommend Alan Hollis to any web design / development company; he is a very gifted coder
                        and
                        would be an asset to your business. Alan is not only hardworking and an all round nice guy; he
                        is
                        someone I believe will succeed in all he sets out to do, it is this mentality accompanied with
                        raw
                        talent that allows him build stable and complex systems.

                        So to conclude, if you have any questions about Alan or his work then please do not hesitate
                        contacting me, my personal email address is mike@mjward.co.uk
