                <p>
                    Leading development teams I've learned not just to manage, but to listen, to motivate and to
                    inspire. Through consulting, I've learned the art of the sale, the value of long lasting connections
                    and the power of recommendation. As a support engineer I've learned to not plaster over problems,
                    but to get to the heart of them.
                </p>

                    Programming has, through practice, hard work and dedication, given me the skills and experience to
                    solve problems. Experimenting with new technologies has shown me the strength of new ideas,
                    demonstrated the robustness of old ones, and taught me to be pragmatic with my selection of tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm not trying out new technology I can be found practicing languages on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/alan01276">duolingo</a>
                    or attempting to play along to some blues on my harmonica.
