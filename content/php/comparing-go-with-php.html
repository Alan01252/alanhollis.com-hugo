                    Variable assignment</h3>
                <p>
                    In PHP variable assigned is very simple :
                </p>
                <pre><code class="php hljs">$myString = "My String";</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In Go this is a little different. Go is statically typed meaning those familiar with other
                    statically
                    typed languages would expect to see something like
                </p>
                <pre><code class="java hljs">String myString = "My String";</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In Go the type can be inferred from the expression. For instance to assign a string to a variable in
                    Go
                    you can do any one of the following:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go hljs">>var myString = "hello"
//or
myString := "Hello"</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    To change the value later Go a single = is used
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go hljs">myString := "myString"
myString = "foo"
fmt.Println(myString) //Prints out Foo</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    I prefer the way variable assignment is done in Go. It makes it very easy to see where the variable
                    has
                    been instantiated, where it's been changed and in 99% of times the type inference isn't an issue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also note that the use of semicolons in Golang is optional
                </p>

                <h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-family: 'Nixie One'; margin-bottom: 20px">
                    If statements</h3>
                If statements are very similar in both PHP and Golang in PHP
                <pre><code class="php hljs">if($i < 3) {
  echo "$i is less than 3";
                     </code>
}</pre>
                In Go
                <pre><code class="go hljs">if x > 0 {
   fmt.Println(x,"is greater than zero")
}</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The biggest difference are the optional brackets around the if statement. Braces are also mandatory
                    and
                    the first brace must be on the same line as the if.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This fits with the <a
                        href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">psr-2
                    PHP fig standards</a> and as such is really familiar to most PHP developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest difference is it's common to see an initialization statement at the beginning of the if
                    statement, so instead of seeing this:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="php hljs">$i = getMyVar();
if($i < 3) {
  echo "$i is less than 3";

}</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    You see
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go hljs">if x:=getMyVar(); x > 0 {
    fmt.Println(x,"is greater than zero")
}</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Personally I'm not keen on this syntax as I find it slightly harder to realise at a glance what the
                    if
                    statement is checking, but this is purely a matter of preference.
                </p>

                    Loops</h3>
                <p>
                    Go takes an usual step when it comes to looping. The familiar while loop seen is most of languages
                    based
                    on C has been unified with the for loop meaning to do this
                </p>
                <pre><code class="php hljs">while($i < 3) {
$i++
}</code>
                </pre>
                In Go you write
                <pre><code class="go hjls">for i < 4 {
    i++
}</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    When I'm writing PHP code I tend to use <em>while</em> for longer running loops, and
                    <em>for</em> for loops over a finite set of data. I find it harder when writing Go code to see, at a
                    glance see what type of loop, the code is performing. This has caused me to code in infinite loops
                    on
                    more than one occasion whilst experimenting with Go.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Go also uses the range clause to achieve similar functionality to PHP's foreach. Where in PHP you
                    would
                    do this
                </p>
                <pre><code class="php hjls">$myArrayOfThings = [1,2,3,4];
foreach($myArrayOfThings as $key => $value) {
  echo $key."-".$value."\n"; //0-1 1-2 2-3 3-4
}</code>
                </pre>
                In Go the range statement is used instead
                <pre><code class="go hjls">myArrayOfInts := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6}
for key,value := range myArrayOfInts {
    fmt.Println(key,value)
}</code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    One of the things I dislike about PHP is the ordering of the foreach statement, and as such I prefer
                    the
                    way Go does it. One minor annoyance with Go is that if you don't use a variable in the code it won't
                    compile. So if you only wish to use the key in the above you can use the magic _ character instead.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go hjls">myArrayOfInts := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6}
for key,_ := range myArrayOfInts {
    fmt.Println(key)
}</code>
                </pre>

                <h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-family: 'Nixie One'; margin-bottom: 20px">
                    Functions</h3>
                <p>
                    Functions in Go allow multiple return values which make moving from PHP to Go a lot easier than it
                    might
                    be moving from other dynamic languages to static languages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In PHP a function can return multiple types, this is useful in a lot of ways for instance, dealing
                    with
                    errors. An example of this in PHP would be:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="php hjls">$result = updateSomething();
if(!$result) {
    return false;
}
echo "Updated id ".$id;</code>
                    </pre>
                <p>
                    In Go we can use the fact that a function can return multiple values to increase code clarity whilst
                    achieving the same effect.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go hjls">int, err := updateSomething()
if err == false {
  return false
}
fmt.Println("Updated id",id)</code>
                    </pre>
