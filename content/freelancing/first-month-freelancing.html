                <strong>What I've learnt</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is plenty of work out there, for someone who knows what they're doing.</li>
                    <li>There are a lot of web development companies looking for full time developer roles.</li>
                    <li>It's hard to say no to full time employment when you're starting out.</li>
                    <li>Most companies will try to bid you down on price, don't accept straight away. Reach a compromise that works for you both.</li>
                    <li>There are a lot of companies making money producing bad code, there's money to be made fixing bad code.</li>
                    <li>There are a lot of failed companies with legacy code which now needs to be maintained.</li>
                    <li>Debugging and finding a solution to a customers problem despite having to wade through bad code <em>is</em> fun.</li>
                    <li>It takes time for people to get back to you, to get contracts sorted, to get feedback on work.</li>
                    <li>Waiting is frustrating. Have a side project to work on whilst you wait.</li>
                    <li>Getting payment terms down to 10 days is impossible for some companies, but not for all.</li>
                    <li>If you don't ask you don't get.</li>
                    <li>People want to pay you hourly/per project, convince them it's better for both you and them to pay you daily. I'll explain why in a future post.</li>
                    <li>Get the specification of work nailed down as thoroughly as you can, it's mutually beneficial to you and your customers.</li>
                    <li>There's a lot more to learn.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>How I found work</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created this blog, hosted it on Rackspace, made it run fast.</li>
                    <li>Emailed web design companies in and around the local area using this Blog as my CV.</li>
                    <li>Posted adverts on Gumtree. ( a free classified ads service in the UK )</li>
                    <li>Posted on web forums for those technologies which I used in their advertisement section.</li>
                    <li>Getting in contact with friends and telling them I've started freelancing. ( A big thank you to all my friends who have been incredibly supportive so far).</li>
                    <li>Entered a programming competition, this hasn't directly lead to work, but I'm hoping might work well for me in the future.</li>
                </ul>
